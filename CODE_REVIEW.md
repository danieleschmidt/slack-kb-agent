# Code Review

## Engineer Review
- `ruff check .` showed no linting issues.
- `bandit -r src -q` reported no security vulnerabilities.
- Tests executed with `pytest -q` all pass. Performance is acceptable for small in-memory operations.

## Product Manager Review
- The "Smart Routing" epic tasks are marked done in `SPRINT_BOARD.md`.
- New modules provide loading of team member profiles, routing queries to experts, and notifying them via Slack.
- Acceptance criteria in `tests/sprint_acceptance_criteria.json` are fully covered by `tests/test_smart_routing.py`.

All acceptance criteria are satisfied and the code base is clean.
