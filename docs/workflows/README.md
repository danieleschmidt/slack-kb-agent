# Workflow Requirements

## Manual Setup Required

This repository requires manual setup of the following GitHub Actions workflows due to permission limitations:

### CI/CD Workflows

* **Pull Request Validation** - Code quality checks, testing, security scans
* **Main Branch Protection** - Automated deployment and release processes
* **Dependency Updates** - Automated dependency management with Dependabot

### Security Workflows

* **Security Scanning** - CodeQL analysis for vulnerability detection
* **Container Scanning** - Docker image security validation
* **Secret Scanning** - Credential leak prevention

### Release Management

* **Automated Releases** - Semantic versioning and changelog generation
* **Documentation Publishing** - Automated docs deployment

## Configuration Files

Pre-configured templates available in `.github/workflows/` (to be created manually):

* `ci.yml` - Continuous integration pipeline
* `security.yml` - Security scanning and analysis
* `release.yml` - Release automation workflow

## Branch Protection

Configure branch protection rules manually in repository settings:

* Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
* Require status checks to pass
* Restrict pushes to matching branches
* Require branches to be up to date

## External Integrations

* **Monitoring**: Configure Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
* **Alerting**: Set up notification channels for critical issues
* **Documentation**: Link to external documentation hosting
