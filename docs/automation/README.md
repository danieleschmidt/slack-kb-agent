# Automation & Metrics Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive automation tools and metrics tracking for the Slack KB Agent project.

## Overview

The automation system provides:
- **Metrics Collection**: Automated tracking of code quality, performance, and business metrics
- **Repository Maintenance**: Automated cleanup, security scanning, and quality checks
- **Project Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of project health indicators
- **Reporting**: Automated generation of project status reports

## Automation Scripts

### 1. Metrics Collection (`scripts/metrics-collection.py`)

Automated collection of project metrics including:
- Code quality metrics (test coverage, complexity, security vulnerabilities)
- Development velocity metrics (commit frequency, PR merge time, issue resolution)
- Operational metrics (deployment frequency, uptime, performance)
- Business impact metrics (user satisfaction, knowledge utilization)

#### Usage
```bash
# Basic metrics collection
python scripts/metrics-collection.py

# With GitHub token for repository metrics
python scripts/metrics-collection.py --github-token $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Generate summary report
python scripts/metrics-collection.py --output-report metrics-report.md

# Dry run (don't save changes)
python scripts/metrics-collection.py --dry-run
```

#### Configuration
The script reads from `.github/project-metrics.json` and updates it with current values.

### 2. Repository Maintenance (`scripts/repository-maintenance.py`)

Automated repository maintenance tasks:
- Cache and temporary file cleanup
- Dependency security updates
- Code quality checks and auto-fixes
- Security scanning
- Test execution and coverage reporting
- Documentation validation
- Git branch cleanup

#### Usage
```bash
# Full maintenance routine
python scripts/repository-maintenance.py

# Dry run to see what would be done
python scripts/repository-maintenance.py --dry-run

# Run specific maintenance tasks
python scripts/repository-maintenance.py --tasks cleanup security quality

# Generate maintenance report
python scripts/repository-maintenance.py --output-report maintenance-report.json
```

#### Available Tasks
- `cleanup`: Remove cache files and temporary directories
- `dependencies`: Check and update dependencies
- `security`: Run security scans (Bandit, Safety, secrets detection)
- `quality`: Code formatting, linting, and type checking
- `tests`: Execute test suite with coverage
- `docs`: Check documentation completeness
- `git`: Clean up merged and stale branches

## Automation Integration

### CI/CD Integration

Add to GitHub Actions workflows:
```yaml
- name: Collect Metrics
  run: python scripts/metrics-collection.py --github-token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

- name: Repository Maintenance
  run: python scripts/repository-maintenance.py --output-report maintenance-report.json
```

### Scheduled Automation

#### Daily Tasks (via GitHub Actions scheduled workflow)
```yaml
name: Daily Maintenance
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # 2 AM UTC daily

jobs:
  maintenance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run maintenance
        run: python scripts/repository-maintenance.py --tasks cleanup security quality
```

#### Weekly Tasks
```yaml
name: Weekly Metrics
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # 9 AM UTC on Mondays

jobs:

## Quality Gates

### Commit-level Gates
- Pre-commit hooks enforce code formatting and basic quality
- Commit message format validation (conventional commits)

### Pull Request Gates
- Required status checks: security analysis, code quality, test suite
- Minimum test coverage threshold
- Code review requirements
- Branch protection rules

### Deployment Gates
- All tests must pass
- Security scans must be clean
- Performance benchmarks must meet thresholds
- Manual approval for production deployments

## Reporting

## Best Practices

### Metrics Collection
1. **Consistency**: Collect metrics at regular intervals
2. **Context**: Include relevant metadata and timestamps
3. **Accuracy**: Validate metric calculations and sources
4. **Actionability**: Focus on metrics that drive decisions
5. **Trend Analysis**: Track changes over time, not just snapshots

### Automation Maintenance
1. **Regular Review**: Monthly review of automation effectiveness
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failures and edge cases
3. **Documentation**: Keep automation documentation up to date
4. **Testing**: Test automation scripts in staging environments
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor automation execution and success rates

### Performance Optimization
1. **Efficiency**: Optimize script execution time and resource usage
2. **Caching**: Cache expensive operations where appropriate
3. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tasks in parallel
4. **Incremental Updates**: Only update changed metrics
5. **Resource Management**: Clean up temporary files and connections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Metrics Collection Failures
```bash
# Check script dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify GitHub token permissions
python scripts/metrics-collection.py --dry-run

# Check file permissions
ls -la .github/project-metrics.json
```

#### Maintenance Script Errors
```bash
# Run in debug mode
python scripts/repository-maintenance.py --dry-run

# Check individual tasks
python scripts/repository-maintenance.py --tasks cleanup --dry-run

# Verify tool installations
bandit --version
safety --version
black --version
ruff --version
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install required tools
pip install safety bandit detect-secrets radon
pip install black ruff mypy pytest pytest-cov

# For GitHub API access
pip install requests
```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Metrics Collection
- Use `--dry-run` to identify bottlenecks
- Check network connectivity for GitHub API calls
- Optimize test execution for coverage collection
- Consider caching intermediate results

#### High Resource Usage
- Monitor memory usage during maintenance
- Clean up temporary files more frequently
- Optimize Git operations for large repositories
- Use incremental processing for large datasets

## Security Considerations

### Token Management
- Store GitHub tokens in environment variables or secrets
- Use minimal required permissions for API access
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Monitor token usage and access logs

### Data Privacy
- Avoid collecting or storing sensitive user data
- Anonymize personal information in metrics
- Comply with data retention policies
- Secure metric storage and transmission

### Access Control
- Limit access to automation scripts and metrics
- Use appropriate file permissions
- Audit automation execution logs
- Implement access controls for reports and dashboards

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Machine learning-based trend prediction
- Automated anomaly detection
- Custom metric definitions
- Advanced reporting templates
- Integration with additional tools (Jira, Confluence, etc.)

### Scalability Improvements
- Distributed metrics collection
- Real-time metric streaming
- Multi-repository support
- Cloud-native deployment options

This automation framework provides a solid foundation for maintaining project health, tracking progress, and ensuring continuous improvement of the Slack KB Agent project.
