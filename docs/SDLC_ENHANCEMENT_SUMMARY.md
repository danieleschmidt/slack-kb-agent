## Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Manual Setup Required**:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflows using templates in `docs/workflows/CI_CD_SETUP.md`
   - Configure repository secrets (PYPI_API_TOKEN, CODECOV_TOKEN, etc.)
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Enable GitHub Container Registry

2. **Automated Setup**:
   - Run `make security-full` to generate initial SBOM
   - Execute performance tests with `make performance`
   - Review and customize monitoring dashboards

### Short-term Goals (Month 1)
1. **Security Hardening**:
   - Complete vulnerability assessment using generated SBOM
   - Implement container security scanning in CI pipeline
   - Set up automated dependency updates

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Baseline performance metrics using new test suite
   - Implement auto-scaling based on operational guidelines
   - Optimize search performance based on benchmark results

### Long-term Goals (Quarter 1)
1. **Advanced Automation**:
   - Implement policy-as-code for security compliance
   - Set up automated disaster recovery testing
   - Deploy comprehensive monitoring stack

2. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Establish performance regression detection
   - Implement automated capacity planning
   - Create advanced security monitoring rules
