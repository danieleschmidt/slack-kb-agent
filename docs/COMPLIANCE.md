## Regulatory Compliance

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Data minimization**: Collect only necessary personal data
- **Right to be forgotten**: Automated data deletion capabilities
- **Data portability**: Export functionality for user data
- **Privacy by design**: Default privacy-preserving configurations

### SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
- **Change management**: Approval workflows for production changes
- **Data integrity**: Immutable audit logs with cryptographic verification
- **Access controls**: Segregation of duties for financial data access

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **PHI protection**: Encrypted storage and transmission of health information
- **Access logging**: Complete audit trail for PHI access
- **Data retention**: Automated retention policy enforcement

## Security Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "Unauthorized access attempt"
    condition: "failed_auth_attempts > 5"
    severity: "high"
    notification: "security-team@company.com"
  
  - name: "Anomalous data access"
    condition: "data_access_pattern_anomaly"
    severity: "medium"
    notification: "ops-team@company.com"
  
  - name: "Vulnerability detected"
    condition: "new_cve_score >= 7.0"
    severity: "critical"
    notification: "security-team@company.com"
```

### Security Metrics
- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: < 5 minutes
- **Mean Time to Response (MTTR)**: < 15 minutes
- **False Positive Rate**: < 2%
- **Coverage**: > 95% of attack vectors

## Compliance Automation

### Policy as Code
```python
# Example security policy enforcement
class SecurityPolicy:
    def validate_deployment(self, deployment):
        checks = [
            self.check_encryption_enabled(deployment),
            self.check_access_controls(deployment),
            self.check_vulnerability_scan(deployment),
            self.check_audit_logging(deployment)
        ]
        return all(checks)
```

### Automated Compliance Checks
- **Pre-deployment**: Security policy validation before release
- **Runtime**: Continuous compliance monitoring
- **Post-incident**: Automated compliance status verification

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data breach | Low | High | Medium | Multi-layer encryption, access controls |
| Supply chain attack | Medium | High | High | SBOM generation, dependency scanning |
| Insider threat | Low | Medium | Low | Zero-trust architecture, audit logging |
| DDoS attack | Medium | Medium | Medium | Rate limiting, CDN protection |
| SQL injection | Low | High | Medium | Parameterized queries, input validation |

## Audit and Assessment

### Internal Audits
- **Frequency**: Quarterly security assessments
- **Scope**: Complete infrastructure and application review
- **Reporting**: Executive dashboard with risk trends

### External Audits
- **Penetration testing**: Annual third-party security assessment
- **Compliance certification**: SOC 2 Type II audit annually
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Bi-annual external security review

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Daily security health check
./scripts/security-health-check.sh

# Weekly compliance verification
./scripts/compliance-check.sh --generate-report

# Monthly risk assessment update
./scripts/risk-assessment.sh --update-matrix
```

## Incident Response Procedures

### Security Incident Classification
- **P0 (Critical)**: Active security breach or data compromise
- **P1 (High)**: Potential security vulnerability exploitation
- **P2 (Medium)**: Security policy violation or suspicious activity
- **P3 (Low)**: Security configuration drift or minor policy violation

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate Response** (0-15 minutes)
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Notify security team
   - Begin incident documentation

2. **Assessment** (15-30 minutes)
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Classify incident severity
   - Engage appropriate response team

3. **Containment** (30-60 minutes)
   - Implement containment measures
   - Preserve evidence
   - Communicate with stakeholders

4. **Recovery** (1-4 hours)
   - Implement remediation plan
   - Verify system integrity
   - Restore normal operations

5. **Post-Incident** (24-48 hours)
   - Conduct lessons learned review
   - Update security measures
   - Document process improvements

## Data Classification

### Sensitivity Levels
- **Public**: Information freely available to the public
- **Internal**: Information restricted to organization members
- **Confidential**: Sensitive business information
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive data requiring special handling

### Handling Requirements
```yaml
data_classification:
  public:
    encryption: false
    access_control: false
    audit_logging: false
  
  internal:
    encryption: true
    access_control: true
    audit_logging: true
  
  confidential:
    encryption: true
    access_control: true
    audit_logging: true
    approval_required: true
  
  restricted:
    encryption: true
    access_control: true
    audit_logging: true
    approval_required: true
    segregation_of_duties: true
```
