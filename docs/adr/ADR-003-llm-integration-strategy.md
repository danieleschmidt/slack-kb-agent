# ADR-003: LLM Integration Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-08-03  
**Authors**: Development Team  
**Reviewers**: Architecture Team, Security Team  

## Context

The Slack Knowledge Base Agent requires integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate contextual, human-like responses based on retrieved knowledge. We need to decide on an LLM integration strategy that balances response quality, cost, reliability, and vendor independence.

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-provider LLM integration strategy** with the following architecture:

### Core Decision Points

1. **Multiple Provider Support**: Support both OpenAI GPT and Anthropic Claude models
2. **Provider Abstraction**: Create a unified interface for LLM interactions
3. **Configurable Routing**: Allow runtime switching between providers
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms when primary provider fails
5. **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent model selection based on query complexity

### Implementation Approach

```python
class LLMProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def generate_response(self, prompt: str, context: List[str]) -> LLMResponse:
        pass

class OpenAIProvider(LLMProvider):
    # OpenAI GPT implementation
    
class AnthropicProvider(LLMProvider):
    # Anthropic Claude implementation

class LLMService:
    def __init__(self, providers: List[LLMProvider], routing_strategy: str):
        self.providers = providers
        self.routing_strategy = routing_strategy
```

## Rationale

### Advantages of Multi-Provider Approach

1. **Vendor Independence**: Reduces lock-in risk and provides negotiation leverage
2. **Reliability**: Automatic failover when one provider experiences outages
3. **Cost Optimization**: Route simple queries to cheaper models, complex ones to premium models
4. **Quality Comparison**: A/B testing capabilities to optimize response quality
5. **Compliance**: Different providers may have different data handling policies

### Provider Selection Criteria

| Criteria | OpenAI GPT-4 | Anthropic Claude | Weight |
|----------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Response Quality | 9/10 | 9/10 | 30% |
| API Reliability | 8/10 | 8/10 | 25% |
| Cost Efficiency | 6/10 | 7/10 | 20% |
| Context Window | 8/10 | 9/10 | 15% |
| Safety Features | 7/10 | 9/10 | 10% |

### Routing Strategy

```python
def select_provider(query_complexity: float, context_length: int) -> str:
    if query_complexity < 0.3 and context_length < 1000:
        return "openai-gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Cost-effective for simple queries
    elif context_length > 8000:
        return "anthropic-claude-2"     # Better for long context
    else:
        return "openai-gpt-4"           # Balanced quality/cost
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Primary Provider
LLM_PRIMARY_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER=anthropic

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.1
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2048

# Anthropic Configuration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-2
ANTHROPIC_TEMPERATURE=0.1
ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS=2048

# Routing Configuration
LLM_ROUTING_STRATEGY=cost_optimized  # options: cost_optimized, quality_first, round_robin
LLM_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true
LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

### Model Selection Matrix

| Query Type | Context Size | Primary Model | Fallback Model | Rationale |
|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Simple FAQ | <500 chars | GPT-3.5-turbo | Claude-instant | Cost optimization |
| Technical Question | 500-2000 chars | GPT-4 | Claude-2 | Balanced quality/cost |
| Complex Analysis | >2000 chars | Claude-2 | GPT-4 | Better long context |
| Code-related | Any | GPT-4 | Claude-2 | Strong code understanding |

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- Use separate keys for development, staging, and production
- Implement key rotation procedures
- Monitor API usage for anomalies

### Data Privacy
- Ensure all providers meet data protection requirements
- Implement audit logging for all LLM interactions
- Consider data residency requirements for enterprise deployments
- Anonymize sensitive information in prompts

### Prompt Injection Prevention
```python
def sanitize_prompt(user_input: str) -> str:
    # Remove potential injection attempts
    sanitized = re.sub(r'(ignore|forget|disregard).+(previous|above|instruction)', '', user_input, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    # Limit input length
    return sanitized[:MAX_PROMPT_LENGTH]
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cache responses for identical prompts (24-hour TTL)
- Implement semantic similarity caching for near-duplicate queries
- Use Redis for distributed caching across instances

### Request Optimization
- Batch similar queries when possible
- Implement request deduplication
- Use streaming responses for real-time user feedback
- Implement circuit breakers for provider failures

## Cost Management

### Usage Monitoring
```python
class UsageTracker:
    def track_request(self, provider: str, model: str, tokens: int, cost: float):
        # Track usage metrics for cost analysis
        self.metrics.record(provider, model, tokens, cost)
        
    def get_monthly_cost(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        # Return cost breakdown by provider
        return self.calculate_costs()
```

### Budget Controls
- Set monthly spending limits per provider
- Implement rate limiting based on cost thresholds
- Alert on unusual usage patterns
- Automatic fallback to cheaper models when budget exceeded

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Single Provider (OpenAI Only)

**Cons**: Infrastructure complexity, model management overhead, potentially lower quality
**Decision**: Consider for future iteration when infrastructure maturity increases

### Hybrid Cloud/Local Deployment
**Pros**: Data sovereignty, cost predictability
**Cons**: Infrastructure complexity, maintenance overhead, scaling challenges
**Decision**: Consider for enterprise customers with specific compliance requirements

## Future Considerations

## Conclusion

The multi-provider LLM integration strategy provides the flexibility, reliability, and cost optimization needed for a production-ready knowledge base system. This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of different providers while maintaining independence and controlling costs.

The implementation will be phased to minimize risk and allow for iterative improvement based on real-world usage patterns and feedback.
