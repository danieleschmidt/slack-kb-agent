# ADR-001: Database Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Slack Knowledge Base Agent requires persistent storage for:
- Knowledge base documents and metadata
- User query history and analytics
- Configuration and settings
- Vector embeddings and search indices

Key requirements:
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Support for complex queries and joins
- Scalability for large knowledge bases
- Backup and restore capabilities
- Migration support

## Decision
We will use **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with **Redis** for caching.

## Rationale

### PostgreSQL Advantages:
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity for critical knowledge base operations
- **Rich Query Support**: Complex queries for analytics and search
- **JSON Support**: Native JSONB support for flexible document storage
- **Vector Extensions**: pgvector extension available for future vector storage
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Extensive tooling, monitoring, and operational support
- **Performance**: Excellent performance with proper indexing
- **Backup/Restore**: Robust backup and point-in-time recovery

### Considered Alternatives:

#### MongoDB
- **Pros**: Document-oriented, flexible schema
- **Cons**: Eventual consistency, limited ACID guarantees, query complexity

#### SQLite
- **Pros**: Lightweight, embedded, zero configuration
- **Cons**: Limited concurrency, not suitable for production scale

#### Vector Databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **Pros**: Optimized for vector operations
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, cost, vendor lock-in

## Implementation
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database abstraction
- Alembic for schema migrations
- Connection pooling for performance
- Redis for caching frequently accessed data

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Strong consistency and data integrity
- Rich querying capabilities for analytics
- Mature operational tooling
- Future extensibility with vector support

### Negative:
- Higher resource requirements than SQLite
- Operational complexity compared to managed services
- Need for PostgreSQL expertise

## Monitoring
- Database performance metrics
- Query execution times
- Connection pool utilization
- Storage growth patterns
