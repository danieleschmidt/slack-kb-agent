# Operational Excellence Guide

This document outlines operational best practices, monitoring strategies, and incident response procedures for the Slack-KB-Agent system.

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### Availability SLOs
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% monthly availability (8.76 hours downtime/month maximum)
- **Search Response Time**: 95% of searches complete within 200ms
- **Knowledge Ingestion**: 99% success rate for document processing
- **Slack Integration**: 99.5% message response rate within 3 seconds

### Performance SLOs
- **Query Throughput**: Support 1000+ concurrent search queries
- **Memory Usage**: Maintain < 80% memory utilization under normal load
- **Database Performance**: < 50ms average query response time
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 85% for frequently accessed content

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### Primary SLIs
```yaml
slis:
  availability:
    - name: "search_success_rate"
      description: "Percentage of successful search requests"
      query: "sum(rate(search_requests_total{status='success'}[5m])) / sum(rate(search_requests_total[5m]))"
      target: "> 0.999"
    
    - name: "response_time_p95"
      description: "95th percentile response time for search queries"
      query: "histogram_quantile(0.95, search_duration_seconds_bucket)"
      target: "< 0.2"
  
  performance:
    - name: "memory_utilization"
      description: "Memory utilization percentage"
      query: "process_resident_memory_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes"
      target: "< 0.8"
    
    - name: "database_response_time"
      description: "Average database query response time"
      query: "avg(database_query_duration_seconds)"
      target: "< 0.05"
```

### Secondary SLIs
- Error rate by component (ingestion, search, Slack integration)
- Resource utilization trends (CPU, disk I/O, network)
- Cache effectiveness metrics
- User satisfaction scores (thumbs up/down on responses)

## Monitoring and Alerting

pg_basebackup -h backup-server -D /var/lib/postgresql/recovery -Ft -z -P
recovery_target_time='2024-01-15 14:30:00'
echo "recovery_target_time = '$recovery_target_time'" >> recovery.conf
echo "recovery_target_action = 'promote'" >> recovery.conf
systemctl start postgresql
```

#### Knowledge Base Recovery
```python
# Knowledge base restoration
from slack_kb_agent.backup import BackupManager

backup_manager = BackupManager()
backup_file = "/backups/knowledge_base_2024-01-15.json.gz"

# Restore from backup
backup_manager.restore_from_backup(backup_file, verify_integrity=True)

# Rebuild search indices
backup_manager.rebuild_search_indices()

# Verify restoration
health_check = backup_manager.verify_restoration()
assert health_check.status == "healthy"
```

    approval: "team lead + senior engineer + ops approval"
```

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated rollback script
PREVIOUS_VERSION=$(kubectl get deployment slack-kb-agent -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.previous-version}')

# Immediate rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/slack-kb-agent

# Verify rollback
kubectl rollout status deployment/slack-kb-agent --timeout=300s

# Update routing
kubectl patch service slack-kb-agent -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"'$PREVIOUS_VERSION'"}}}'

# Notify stakeholders
curl -X POST "$SLACK_WEBHOOK" -d '{"text":"Rollback completed to version '$PREVIOUS_VERSION'"}'
```

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Efficiency
- **Right-sizing**: Automated resource allocation based on usage patterns
- **Spot Instances**: Use spot instances for non-critical batch processing
- **Reserved Capacity**: Long-term reservations for predictable workloads

cost_controls:
  budgets:
    monthly_limit: "$1000"
    alert_thresholds: [50%, 80%, 95%]
    actions:
      80%: "notify_team"
      95%: "scale_down_non_critical"
      100%: "emergency_shutdown"
  
  optimization:
    storage_lifecycle: "move to cheaper tiers after 30 days"
    compute_scheduling: "scale down 70% during off-hours"
    data_retention: "automated cleanup after 90 days"
```

## Security Operations

### Distributed Tracing
```python
# OpenTelemetry instrumentation
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

@tracer.start_as_current_span("search_knowledge_base")
def search_knowledge_base(query):
    span = trace.get_current_span()
    span.set_attribute("query.length", len(query))
    span.set_attribute("query.type", classify_query(query))
    
    try:
        results = perform_search(query)
        span.set_attribute("results.count", len(results))
        span.set_attribute("search.status", "success")
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        span.set_attribute("search.status", "error")
        span.set_attribute("error.type", type(e).__name__)
        raise
```
