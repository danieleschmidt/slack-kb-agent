      Fix abstract base classes that have unimplemented methods which will cause
      NotImplementedError crashes when the system tries to extend functionality.
      Critical for system stability and extensibility.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - BaseSource.load() properly implemented or has clear error handling
      - BaseIngester.ingest() properly implemented or has clear error handling
      - All abstract methods have concrete implementations
      - Test coverage for error scenarios
      - Documentation for unsupported features

      Replace time.sleep(0.1) with await asyncio.sleep(0.1) in slack_bot.py
      to prevent blocking the async event loop during shutdown operations.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Replace time.sleep with asyncio.sleep in shutdown sequence
      - Ensure method is properly async
      - Test async shutdown behavior
      - Verify no event loop blocking

      ✅ COMPLETED: Added circuit breaker protection to all database operations in DatabaseManager 
      and DatabaseRepository to prevent cascading failures during PostgreSQL outages.
      Covers connection establishment, session management, and all CRUD operations.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - ✅ Circuit breaker protects all database operations in DatabaseManager
      - ✅ Database session creation/management is protected
      - ✅ Repository operations (CRUD) are protected with circuit breaker
      - ✅ Graceful degradation when circuit is open
      - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for failure scenarios
      - ✅ Metrics integration for circuit breaker state
