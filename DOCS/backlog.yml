      Add circuit breaker protection to all database operations in DatabaseManager 
      and DatabaseRepository to prevent cascading failures during PostgreSQL outages.
      Covers connection establishment, session management, and all CRUD operations.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Circuit breaker protects all database operations in DatabaseManager
      - Database session creation/management is protected
      - Repository operations (CRUD) are protected with circuit breaker
      - Graceful degradation when circuit is open
      - Comprehensive test coverage for failure scenarios
      - Metrics integration for circuit breaker state

    security_notes: "No security implications - improves availability"
    rollback_plan: "Circuit breaker can be disabled via configuration"
