## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. DO NOT create a public GitHub issue

Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities can put users at risk. Instead, please report vulnerabilities privately.

### 2. Send a report to our security team

**Email**: security@slack-kb-agent.com  
**Subject**: Security Vulnerability Report - [Brief Description]

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Version, configuration, and environment details
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the vulnerability

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of receiving your report
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 7 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate public disclosure after a fix is available

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
2. **Token Management**: Rotate Slack tokens and API keys regularly
3. **Access Control**: Limit bot permissions to minimum required scope
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
5. **Updates**: Keep the application updated to the latest secure version

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for all endpoints
3. **Authorization**: Follow principle of least privilege
4. **Secrets Management**: Use environment variables or secure vaults
5. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Slack Token Validation**: Secure token handling with environment variables
- **API Key Authentication**: Support for monitoring endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Multi-tier rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Sanitization**: Protection against injection attacks

### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data Detection**: Automatic redaction of API keys, passwords, tokens
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of queries and responses
- **Permission Boundaries**: Respects Slack channel permissions
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Non-root user execution in containers
- **Network Isolation**: Proper network segmentation in deployments
- **Health Checks**: Monitoring endpoints for service health
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits to prevent resource exhaustion

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Report vulnerabilities privately to our security team
2. **Assessment Period**: We assess and validate reported vulnerabilities
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test fixes for confirmed vulnerabilities
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We coordinate public disclosure with the reporter
5. **Recognition**: We recognize security researchers in our Hall of Fame

## Security Scanning

We use multiple layers of security scanning:

- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL and Bandit for code security analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety and pip-audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for container image vulnerabilities
- **Secret Scanning**: GitGuardian for credential leak detection
- **License Compliance**: Automated license compliance checking

## Security Incidents

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems and assess impact
2. **User Notification**: Notify affected users within 24 hours
3. **Incident Analysis**: Conduct thorough analysis of the incident
4. **Remediation**: Implement fixes and security improvements
5. **Public Disclosure**: Provide transparent communication about the incident
