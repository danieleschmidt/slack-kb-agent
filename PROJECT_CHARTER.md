# Project Charter: Slack Knowledge Base Agent

## Project Overview

### Mission Statement
Provide intelligent, context-aware question-answering capabilities for teams through Slack integration, reducing information silos and improving team productivity by making institutional knowledge accessible and searchable.

### Problem Statement
Teams struggle with:
- Scattered documentation across multiple platforms
- Difficulty finding answers to common questions
- Knowledge silos when team members are unavailable
- Time wasted searching through chat history and documentation
- Inconsistent answers to recurring questions

### Solution Approach
An AI-powered Slack bot that:
- Indexes multiple knowledge sources (GitHub, docs, Slack history, files)
- Provides intelligent search with semantic understanding
- Delivers contextual responses with source citations
- Learns from team interactions to improve over time
- Maintains security and privacy boundaries

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Response Accuracy**: >85% of questions receive relevant, helpful answers
2. **Response Time**: <3 seconds average response time for common queries
3. **User Adoption**: >70% of team members actively using the bot within 30 days
4. **Knowledge Coverage**: Index 100% of public documentation and issues
5. **Availability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Daily active users in Slack
- Questions answered vs escalated to humans
- User satisfaction ratings for responses
- Knowledge base growth rate
- Search query success rate

### Business Value
- Reduce average question resolution time by 60%
- Decrease support ticket volume by 40%
- Improve onboarding experience for new team members
- Increase documentation usage and quality
- Enable 24/7 basic support coverage

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Slack bot integration with @mentions, DMs, slash commands
- Multi-source knowledge ingestion (GitHub, docs, files, Slack history)
- Semantic and keyword search capabilities
- LLM-powered response generation
- Usage analytics and monitoring
- CLI interface for direct queries
- PostgreSQL database persistence
- Security features and access controls

### Out of Scope
- Integration with other chat platforms (Teams, Discord)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced workflow automation
- Custom model training
- Multi-language support (initial release)
- Integration with external ticketing systems

### Dependencies
- Slack workspace access and app creation permissions
- GitHub organization access for repository indexing
- LLM API access (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- PostgreSQL database infrastructure
- Redis cache infrastructure (optional but recommended)

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Engineering Teams**: Primary users, provide feedback on accuracy
- **Product Managers**: Define requirements, success metrics
- **DevOps/Platform**: Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring
- **Security Team**: Access controls, data protection compliance

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Support Teams**: Benefit from reduced ticket volume
- **Technical Writers**: Improve documentation based on usage patterns
- **Leadership**: Monitor productivity impact and ROI

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Knowledge Ingestion**: Support GitHub, file systems, web docs, Slack history
2. **Search Capabilities**: Hybrid semantic + keyword search with configurable weights
3. **Response Generation**: Context-aware responses with source citations
4. **User Interface**: Slack integration (mentions, DMs, slash commands) + CLI
5. **Analytics**: Track usage patterns, popular questions, knowledge gaps
6. **Administration**: CLI tools for database management, backups, migrations

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: <3s response time, support 1000+ concurrent users
2. **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime, graceful degradation when dependencies fail
3. **Security**: Encrypt data at rest/transit, respect access controls, audit logging
4. **Scalability**: Handle 10K+ documents, 100+ users, horizontal scaling ready
5. **Maintainability**: Comprehensive testing, clear documentation, modular design

### Quality Attributes
- **Usability**: Intuitive Slack interactions, helpful error messages
- **Accuracy**: Relevant results with proper source attribution
- **Privacy**: Automatic sensitive data detection and redaction
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, metrics, health checks

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **LLM API Rate Limits**: Mitigation - caching, multiple providers, graceful fallback
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Mitigation - access controls, audit logging, data redaction
- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigation - phased rollout, comprehensive testing

### Medium Risk
- **User Adoption**: Mitigation - training sessions, clear documentation, user feedback loops
- **Knowledge Quality**: Mitigation - source validation, user feedback, continuous improvement
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Mitigation - usage monitoring, optimization, cost alerts

### Low Risk
- **Technology Changes**: Mitigation - modular architecture, vendor abstraction layers
- **Team Capacity**: Mitigation - clear documentation, knowledge transfer
